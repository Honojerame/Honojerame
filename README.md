<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Precious Onojerame</h1>
<h3 align="center">Engineer by day, code whisperer by night — blending circuits and syntax at ENMU ⚙️💻</h3>

* 🔭 I’m currently juggling:

  * Predicting solar power with machine learning (because the sun deserves analytics) ☀️📊
  * Translating ancient Japanese texts with AI (yes, really!) 🇯🇵🤖
  * Building web apps that don’t crash... often 😅

* 🌱 Actively leveling up in:
  `Microelectronics`, `IoT`, `LangChain`, `Next.js`, and the eternal quest for better coffee ☕

* 🔌 My background fuses two worlds:

  * **Electrical/Electronics Engineering**: Circuit design, embedded systems, automation, and making tiny components do big things 🛠️
  * **Computer Science**: Full-stack development, AI/ML, data wrangling, and convincing computers to listen to me 🧠💬

* 👯 Let’s build something awesome together in:
  ML-powered research, smart devices, or full-stack apps that make life smoother

* ⚡ Fun fact:
  Once debugged an Arduino circuit with a paperclip and prayer. Still counts. 🙏📎
