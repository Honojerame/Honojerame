### Hi there! 👋 I'm Precious Onojerame

Engineer by day, code whisperer by night — blending circuits and syntax at ENMU ⚙️💻

### 👤 About Me
Hi, I’m Precious — a double major in **Computer Science** and **Electronics Engineering Technology** with a 3.95 GPA, a love for building smart things, and a knack for making tech fun and functional. Whether I’m translating ancient texts with AI or fine-tuning electromechanical systems, I’m all about turning imagination into innovation.

Currently juggling:
- 🌞 Predicting solar power with machine learning (because the sun deserves analytics)
- 📜 Translating ancient Japanese texts using transformer-based AI models
- 🌐 Building full-stack web apps that don’t crash… (often 😅)
